Bean Factory

Bean Factory is utilized for dependency injection, which means providing a class with the resources and instances of other objects/tools 
needed to function. Bean Factory manages beans (objects), which can be lazily initialized and injected. It is lightweight, fast, and 
easy to understand, and is preferably used for simple applications with limited resources.

Application Context

Application Context is a superset of Bean Factory, meaning it provides bean (object) dependency injection, creation, and 
initialization similar to Bean Factory, plus advanced features. Some of these features include eager initialization 
(objects and dependencies created at startup), event publishing, and resource management. 
Application Context is the preferred object manager for more complex applications.
